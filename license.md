How to read this license
-----------------------

Legal documents are a pain to navigate because they require precise and complete documentation about everything that is related. Because of this, they can easily get very long and hard to understand. This license document is hopefully crafted to be a little easier to understand. 

There are 5 sections to this license document. The first is a summary of what the license is about, this is NOT a legally binding description of the license, this is simply for convenience. If you need to know the terms of the license you must read the rest of the license. The summary should be considered to be just a quick introduction to the license. Then comes the definitions, which will define terms that will be used later in the license. Third will be your rights (as a user of the code), which will be followed by the license terms, which is what you must do in order to obtain those rights. Finally there will be a disclaimer, one of those generic all in capitals sections that basically says you can't sue me.

The definitions and disclaimer sections are pretty dry, and they are there in order to disambiguate any meaning in the rest of the license. By making the definitions long and dry, the terms and rights are able to be much shorter and easier to understand.

Summary
-------------

Basically you can do whatever you want with this code, so long as you credit me, remove my personal information and buy me a drink if you meet me. If you decide to distribute this product to end users (in any way, whether by selling or hosting) then you must either license it under this agreement, or provide a link back to my website or github page to find the original code.

Definitions:

person - Any human or other sentient being.

file - an electronic sequence of bits that's purpose is to represent some text or object. A file may be in many formats, including several different ways to represent the same text or object (for example if a file is compressed or encrypted).

programming language - any general purpose or specialized language which consists of a grammar which can be understood by a computer, or computer program to be a series of commands to be carried out, and perform some action.

code - Any document or file, or part thereof which is interpreted or compiled by another program in order to complete some actions. Code is text or bytes that conform to a valid grammar of any programming language. This includes, but is not limited to javascript source files, html source files, template files, batch scripts, deployment scripts or git control scripts. This also includes executable versions of files.

source code - Any code which is in the preferred format for editing the code. This includes any format that the author of the code used to generate any format or version. Generate in this context means generated by a computer or computer program, and not used as resources to be transformed by the author. This means documents used to plan the source code are not necessarily included (only if they auto-generated any part of the code). When trying to determine what is considered source code for any particular code, the following algorithm can be used:
    
	Step 1: Take the code, and mark any sections which were not written by a person, that is they were generated by a computer or computer program
    Step 2: For each section, find all the code required for those computer programs to regenerate the above code.
    Step 3: For the new code, go back to step 1 and continue this loop until there is no new code added in step 2.

binary code - Any code which is generated by a computer or computer program to be in a different format for any purpose, whether it's easier for a computer to understand, or in a format required by a 3rd party. All code that is not source code is binary code.

data - Any document or file, or part thereof that is not code is considered data. This includes, but is not limited to, pictures, personal information, settings as well as many others.

personal data - Any data or sections of code which include information that pertains to or describes the life, history, achievements and accomplishments of a person.

desensitized data - Any data that contains no personal data within it.

desensitized code - Any code that contains no personal data within it.

repo - Any code or data that this license pertains to, which is part of this repository or folder/directory.

user - Any person which uses any code within the repo. Use in this case means running the code through a computer program to perform it's actions, or inspecting the code for the purpose of performing some action. Using in this context should be considered as broad as it can be, covering any possible use of the code.

derivative work - Any code that is created by a person based on the code contained in this repo. This does not include code that is generated automatically by a computer program.

terms - the conditions set out in the "Terms" section of this license.
