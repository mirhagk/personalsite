Will I Ever Finish School?
====

This is a question I am asked a lot, as I'm roughly halfway through a computer science degree, but I'm working full time (and have been for a few years). In this post I'd like to share my answer and my reasoning.

I question quite often whether I need to. There's several reasons for going to school, and I'm not sure any of them really apply anymore. Note that this is only going to cover university in this post, as I perceive college differently.

To Learn
---

The first reason why people might think of going to University. But University absolutely sucks for learning. The course material is vastly irrelevant and outdated, and you'd learn faster from any of the free online courses, or just reading wikipedia.

Some of the things I learned from University:

+ How to implement quicksort in Haskell. Just kidding, they taught that completely wrong (quicksort is an in place algorithm, that's actually really hard to do in Haskell). They did teach Haskell, but I spent roughly 2-3 nights reading "Learn You a Haskell For Great Good", which is a free online book, and learned FAR more than what the course taught.
+ 3 separate, but useless assembly languages. 1 was a custom made Haskell DSL, another was Marie (which has the awkward restriction of working with a single operand and an accumulator). The last one was at least a real assembly language at one point, MIPS. That one was simply outdated rather than being completely useless. 
+ Formally proving that `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`. I don't plan on going into research so that one was a waste of time.
+ How to write various algorithms and data structures that I will never need to write since someone else will always have a better implementation in whatever language I want to do. And if I really had to I could just read the article on wikipedia when I actually needed. Note that there was very little time spent on how and where to use them, and what was taught was horribly wrong (linked lists are almost never the right solution for performance).
+ Introduction to python, basically what you'd expect out of a grade 9 bootcamp.
+ How to write a terrible, horrible implementation of a database, but not how to use them. 

Almost every single thing I learned from university I could've learned from a blog post (and for most of them I learned it from a blog post anyways because they teach things way better than professors do). **Essentially the most useful thing I got from university was a course outline.**


University also has this knack for teaching stuff in a way where you won't remember any of it 6 months from when you learn it. This is because you are learning 5-6 different things at a time, and the hardest course tends to take all your focus, while also simultaneously being the most useless (highly theoretical and academic math). They also promote cramming for exams, which time and time again has been proven to be useless for anything other than regurgitating material onto an exam. 

If you want to run an experiment, give the same exam to someone who took a course 6 months ago (who didn't get a chance to study again) and see how well they do. Try again 3 years later and see what the results are. Give it to someone who is able to look at wikipedia and see what the results are (remember that no developer works in a place without access to the internet).

The theory is that when you actually learn it again you'll have an easier time learning it, but I think the easier time learning it comes from the better learning materials (focus on real world, actually designed to teach) and the actual need to learn it (I always have an easier time learning stuff I need than stuff I don't need).
