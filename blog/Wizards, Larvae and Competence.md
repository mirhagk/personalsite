Wizards, Larvae and Competence
===

In business management there are claims that there are [4 types of workers][4typesworker]. They are summarized below:

+ Passionate Employee - Cares about the company's success - Vastly exceeds expectations
+ Professional Employee - Cares about personal success - Exceeds expectations, but doesn't help others 
+ Paycheck Employee - Cares about their paycheck - Meets expectations
+ Problem Employee - Doesn't care - Does just enough that you'd like to fire them, but they'll sue you if you try

There are many books and theories about how to best manage the different types, and help people move from one type to another, so I won't go too far into that. 

As Developers
---

Instead I'd like to describe the software world, and how to identify the different types. In the software world you can see:

+ Wizards - AKA "rockstars", these developers are the ones who can do absolutely amazing things, the "10x programmer" who is vastly more productive than anyone else
+ Larvae - These programmers are quite clever but they often look down on others, and usually lack in soft skills.
+ Competent Devs - These are the guys that can get things done and learn what they need to learn, but they aren't up to date on the latest technologies and the tend to prefer what they did in the past over trying newer stuff (even when there's clear reasons to use the newer technology).
+ Incompetent Devs - These are the ones that somehow have managed to stay employed even though everything they touch breaks and they don't do anything unless someone keeps bugging them.

Now before we go much farther, there's nothing wrong with being "just" a competent dev. There's obviously a problem with incompetent devs (who need to figure something else, whether that's improving their skill and attitudes or finding somewhere else), but the other programmers aren't necessarily better people. The wizards are more productive to the company, but that doesn't make competent devs worthless or lesser. Even incompetent devs aren't necessarily bad people, they just aren't pulling their weight at the company.

For the rest of the article I'm going to assume that the company has dealt with the incompetent devs (either helped them become competent, or helped them start their career elsewhere). How you do that is FAR outside of the scope of this blog post, and FAR beyond my skills (most companies struggle with this).

A healthy workplace will have a mix of the first 3 types of programmers. How that mix is made up will vary by team to team, but all 3 types can provide value to a team (and should all be worth the salary you are paying them). That being said wizards are definitely hard to find, and not easy to assess through interviews and resumes.

Having a life outside of work
---

Some people think that developers that "live and breath code" are better than those that have other hobbies and interests. Others insist that the ones who have other hobbies are better than those who are focused on programming. The truth is, they are both right.

If we look at the 3 programmers that make up a healthy workplace and look at who has external hobbies we see that both the highest skilled and lowest skilled developers have lives. That is true as:

+ Wizards - Know technologies, and know enough to efficiently read and stay current without sacrificing all their time
+ Larvae - Very much focused on learning everything they can, will spend most of their time awake in front of a screen, doing something related to programming
+ Competent Devs - After they clock out of work they get it out of their mind. Work does not consume them at all

**Only Larvae spend all their time on software.**

So seeing that someone has a life outside of work doesn't help you determine if they are a wizard or not. It can only help you figure out whether they are a larvae or not. If you use this as a filter for hiring you'll get either all larvae, or a mix of wizards and competent devs without any larvae. Neither one is good, and they equal out to around the same in terms of productivity.
