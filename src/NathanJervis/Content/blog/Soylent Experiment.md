KISS Soylent Experimnt
====

For those of you who don't know Soylent, it's basically the concept of creating a formula which has all the nutrients you need, and taking away the need to cook food.

There is an official recipe, which went through a kickstarter, and soon you will be able to order packages directly, however the cost is still relatively high. Not as expensive as most people's diets, but still more expensive than the classic "student" diets of tuna sandwiches and Kraft Dinner.

There is however an entire community creating DIY recipes for different purposes. One such recipe is the KISS recipe (Keep It Simple Stupid). This recipe is designed to be relatively simple, not using a lot of bulk chemicals.

Anyone who knows me knows I don't really care about that, the part I do care about is the price point. The recipe costs just $1.19/day.

Now stop and think about that, that's the cost per day. If you ate only soylent, it'd cost you just $434.35 per year to eat. The typical student pays twice that just for textbooks.

So does it actually work? Well I decided it's the right price to put it to the test. Well once the ingredients arrive I'll start my solyent diet.

Now people have done soylent only for a month, but the reviews come back pretty similar. They miss regular food, not because of health reasons, but for social reasons. You begin to realize most of your social outings are centered around food. People have even said they miss eating.

The recipe I've selected also has the benefit that it can probably be made into solid bars. This means I could eat soylent as basically a granola bar, making me feel better about myself (most people don't like the idea of getting all their food through a tube). I'm also not going to force myself into a soylent-only diet, because this isn't realistic. Instead I will have 2 meals a day as soylent, and for the last I can either have soylent or eat food with normal people. This is a long term, sustainable diet, and replacing 2 of my meals a deal will not only save me quite a bit of money, but also make me healthier (I don't exactly watch my nutrient intake).

The recipe can be found [here][kissRecipe], but in case it changes, here's the version I'm using:

|Ingredient | Amount|
|---|---|
| Canola Oil | 60ml |
| Nu-Salt | 3g |
| Iodised Salt | 3.2g |
| Corn Starch | 217g |
| Soy Protein Isolate | 30g |
| Vitamin K Supplement | 0.5g |
| Epsom Salt | 3.5g |
| Soy Flour | 130g |
| Equate One Daily (Men's Health) | 1g |
| Vitamin C Powder | 0.036g |
| Calcium Carbonate | 1.5g |
| Choline Bitartrate | 1g |
| Olive Oil | 16g |

So the recipe is mostly corn starch and soy flour. I will be premixing the dry ingredients into monthly packs, so I can organize it better, and so that I can sell friends monthly packs. Each month is about 12KG of powder, plus the oils.

From the pre-mixed powder I will add the oils and make it into bars. I will mold the bars into about 65g each, which means I'll need 6 bars each day (this allows me to do smaller meals more often, which is supposedly good for you as well).
