  body: "For this site I have decided to use Ember JS, and to make the entire site without a backend. That means that it will work in any file server, which will make it cheap to run. In order to make it without a backend, and not pull my hair out, I needed a front-end MVC framework. I've only ever worked with AngularJS so I decided to try out EmberJS, and this website is my experiment with it. I'm not going to lie, it's not really that easy to understand what's actually going on, but once everything is understood, it is *very* powerful. I like it"
