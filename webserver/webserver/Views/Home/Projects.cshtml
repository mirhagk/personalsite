    @Helper.Heading("Personal Site")
    <p>This site is my personal site on <a href="https://github.com/mirhagk/personalsite">github</a>. Feel free to go there and fork this site for yourself.</p>
    <p>The philosphy of this site is to have a lightweight site, with minimal code and default styles that look good without any work.</p>
    @Helper.SubHeading("Near Single-Page-Application")
    <p>This website does partial page updates, not needing to refresh the entire page on navigation.</p>
    <p>This is accomplished with a small component that could be added to a regular server-side ASP.NET website. This component is in the process of being extracted into a library that can be deployed through a nuget package.</p>

    @Helper.Heading("BusTap")
    <p><a href="http://bustap.ca">BusTap</a> is a simple web application that tells you the time when the next bus will come to a specific stop. Throughout a city at busstops there are stickers equipped with NFC tags.</p>
    <p>If you tap the sticker with your phone, it'll instantly show you the time of the next bus for that stop.</p>
    <p>This project is currently preparing for a limited rollout of the system to bustops within the Hamilton area.</p>
