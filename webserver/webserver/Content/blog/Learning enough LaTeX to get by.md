What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a great markup/typesetting language that produces professional documents for almost no work. It also allows for typesetting mathematical formulas or arbitrary equations. It is a critical to know for anyone in a technical field that plans on writing papers, or any undergrads wanting to impress profs with their assignments.

LaTeX must be really hard

If you're thinking LaTeX is really hard, then you'll be glad to know that you are wrong. LaTeX certainly has it's quirks, and if you plan on becoming a LaTeX master you will have to study ancient tomes, and be prepared to learn for years. You don't need to be a LaTeX master to create awesome documents though, you just need to know a few tricks, this post will hopefully get you on your way with LaTeX in no time.

Installation - blah, blah, blah

The first step is to install LaTeX. You have to choose what package you want to install, since there are many different editors available. Personally on windows I like [Texworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/) but you can feel free to install whichever you want, the differences are just in the editor, not in the actual documents you'll write.
