Always remember, "Duke Nukem Forever" sucked
---

Duke Nukem Forever was a video game notorious for how long it took to develop. It was a promised sequel to the Duke Nukem series. It was announced in 1997 and by 2001 they simply said it'd be released "when it's done". In 2007 they released another trailer and then again nothing came of it. It was until 2011, 14 years after the initial announcement, that the game was released. At first you'd think it was good that they took their time and made it right, but the end result ended up being rather lackluster and not overly enjoyable. Certainly did not live up to the quality of the previous games, or people's expectations.

The words for today should remind you that taking your time with software doesn't always produce a high quality product (and often times ends up with the opposite). Don't get so caught up in making the perfect program that you forget to release it.
