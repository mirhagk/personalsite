Plans for resume site
=====================

Resume generation plans
---------------
+ NodeJS script that will generate the resume based on a template and the resume.js source file. 

+ It will also be possible to do some smart generation of the resume, shrinking/expanding sections based on job description (basically analyze for key terms, match key terms in job description to experience and projects, and expand/shrink based on that)

+ Several resume formats/templates to choose from as well. Resume format uses handlebar syntax similar to emberjs in order to generate the file (`{{item.data}}` `{{#each}}` etc)

+ Combine technologies section, or expand
